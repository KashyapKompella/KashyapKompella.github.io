Hi, 

Welcome to my portfolio website! I am a graduate student from Northeastern University, Boston, with a strong passion for blockchain technology and cryptographic protocols.

My fascination with this field began during my time at Oracle, where I worked as a golang developer. It was there that I delved into the world of blockchain and started to unravel the intricacies of cryptographic protocols. Understanding the consensus protocol of Hyperledger Fabric sparked my interest in ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), and I was captivated by the elegance and power of elliptic curves.

As I continued to explore this fascinating domain, I found myself swimming through the realms of interactive and non-interactive proofs, delving into succinct knowledge protocols. Currently, my focus lies in taming the challenges posed by Groth-16 and KgZ commitment schemes, with the aim of reducing proof generation time and complexity.

The looming threat of quantum computing, expected to arrive by August 30, 2024, has further fueled my quest to explore and develop quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols.

I swam through interactive and non interactive proofs crossed succinct knowledge protocols and currently roaming with the dark monsters, Groth-16 and KgZ commitment schemes to reduce the proof generation time and complexity. I fear the wrath of quantum expected to come at August 30,2024 with ability to break all the current encryptions leading to new era of this world internet. -->
